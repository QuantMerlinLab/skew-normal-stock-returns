# skew-normal-stock-returns
This project demonstrates the application of skew-normal distributions in finance, specifically for modeling stock returns that exhibit asymmetry. The skew-normal distribution extends the normal distribution by adding a shape parameter Î± that controls skewness while maintaining normal-like tail behavior.
